## OOPSJS Playground.

This repository contains a couple of experiments I've programmed as a quick refresher. It contains scripts built in pure JS and some include ES6 features.

The topics covered in this repo are:

- Prototypical inheritance.
- Getters, setters and private properties.
- CommonJS Modules.
- OOP ES6.
- Method riding (ES6).
- ES6 Tooling Babel + Webpack.

It also includes a couble of exercises:
